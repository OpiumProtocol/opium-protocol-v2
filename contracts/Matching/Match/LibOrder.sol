        Structure of order
        Description should be considered from the order signer (maker) perspective

        makerMarginAddress - address of token that maker is willing to pay with
        takerMarginAddress - address of token that maker is willing to receive

        makerAddress - address of maker
        takerAddress - address of counterparty (taker). If zero address, then taker could be anyone

        senderAddress - address which is allowed to settle the order on-chain. If zero address, then anyone could settle

        relayerAddress - address of the relayer fee recipient
        affiliateAddress - address of the affiliate fee recipient

        feeTokenAddress - address of token which is used for fees

        makerTokenId - tokenId of position, that maker is willing to pay
        makerTokenAmount - amount of position tokens that maker is willing to pay
        makerMarginAmount - amount of margin token that maker is willing to pay
        takerTokenId - tokenId of position, that maker wants to receive. Create new derivative with this tokenId in case of calling Match.create(). Swap to this tokenId in case Match.swap() is called.
        takerTokenAmount - amount of tokens that maker wants to receive
        takerMarginAmount - amount of margin that maker wants to receive

        relayerFee - amount of fee in feeToken that should be paid to relayer
        affiliateFee - amount of fee in feeToken that should be paid to affiliate

        nonce - unique order ID
        expiresAt - UNIX timestamp of order expiration. Zero for Good-Till-Cancel order

        signature - Signature of EIP712 message. Not used in hash, but then set for order processing purposes
